# These Ansible tasks only run on the client machine where Muchos runs
# At a high level, the various sections in this file do the following:
# 1. Create (if not already existing): an Azure resource group, virtual network / subnet
# 2. Optionally (if the user specified) create a VM and related resources to use as a proxy host
# 3. Create the Azure VMSS to support the nodes for use with Muchos
# 4. Automatically populate the hosts file and associated [nodes] section in muchos.props
